The game was created with the help of Unity, using the New Input System and AR Foundation.
The project is a memorial play where the player must find 4 pairs of animals. Animals on maps appear randomly when they are placed in the game area.
The cards are opened in pairs, if the pair of animals is not the same, the cards return to their initial state. After finding a pair of identical animals, 
the cards disappear from the playing field.
After the disappearance of all cards, the game ends with the inscription "You won".
